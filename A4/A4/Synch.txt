for this assignment we did not have enough time to add in synchronization details and 
we did not want to mess up the code we have now since it works.
but if we were to add in synchronization, we would do it similar to assignment 3 where
in order to avoid race conditions, we would have queues for file system data structures, 
such as the inode table, the inode and data bitmaps. Therefore if we were to add or remove 
new entries concurrently in the same directory data blocks, we would have to wait for its 
turn in the queue.
