# CSC369

A1: Hijacking System Calls and Monitoring Processes
  - Write and installed a very basic kernel module to the linux module
  - Implemented new system calls

A2: Virtual Memory (Page Tables and Replacement Algorithms)
  - Implemented page replacement algorithms such as LRU, FIFO, OPT, and rand
  - Implement virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using two-level page table

A3: Job Scheduling and Synchronization System
  - Worked with synchronization primitives to implement a job scheduling and executionsystem in C
  - This system admits jobs in a set of queues and executes them in order while keeping track of the operational data given

A4: File Systems
  - Explored the implementation of ext2 file system and write tools to modify ext2-formatvirtual disks
  - Implemented tools ext2_mkdir, ext2_cp, ext2_rm, and ext2_ln, each tool takes a disk image which is setup in a particular way to test our implementation
